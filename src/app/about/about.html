    <h2>Your Story</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2026, Jaya charitable trust began with a small group of dedicated volunteers serving meals to homeless families and supporting children in need. Witnessing the struggles of poverty, disability, and malnutrition in our communities inspired us to create a lasting solution. Today, we reach thousands of families every month, providing hope and essential support to those who need it most.</p>
